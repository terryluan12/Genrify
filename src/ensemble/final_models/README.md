# Ensemble Models

This directory is where all finals models should be placed

Since the saved models contain millions of parameters, it isn't practical to include each saved model as part of this repository

A possible solution would be to download each model externally, but for simplicity, each .pt file should be placed in their 
respective folder before running the enemble model.

For example, if you wish to include you .pt file for spectrogram, place your .pt file into the "spectrogram_model" folder and
ensure that the .pt file is named "model.pt"
